  Students have relied on Sinclair and Hamilton library for all their emergency studying and napping needs, and with the recent Sinclair    hour change there are a lot of students study-place-less. The Akamai Nook is a free to use web application that allows students to  find and rate their favorite place to study, give real-time feed back of how wonderful a newly discovered nook is.

<h3 id="10">Profile</h3>

  **this page is still undergoing construction** 
  <br>
  Now that the user is registered and logged in, they are able to view their profile. The profile page will allow users to check what nook they have uploaded, and have control over their email address and password. 
</p>

<h3 id="11">Add Page</h3>
<p>
  This is a simple page that allows user to add their favorite nook. Our scope is to allow the user to enter the name, a short description, upload an image, select tags, and enter the hours of operation. Of course, some users may be discouraged to enter all of the field, so not all of the fields will be mandatory. For data purposes, currently all fields are mandatory and image will require a link instead of an upload. 
</p>
<img src="/images/add.png" width="500px" align="middle">

<h3 id="12">Admin Page</h3>
<p>
  The admin will have full control of which location to add to our archives and which location to decline. Because this is a relatively small scoped project, we plan to manually update the maps and location cards as the requests come in. This allows us to take our time and actually fill out the description of the locations if needed, such as taking a photo of the location if the submittion lacks one.
